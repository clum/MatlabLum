These files are taken from the Matlab example for the quadcopter project and moved to this location so they can be executed by themselves within the UWMatlab SDK.

To access the original project demonstrating some of this functionality type 'asbQuadcopterStart' into the command window.

The original files are located at C:\Users\<USERNAME>\MATLAB\Projects\slexamples\asbQuadcopter\support
